This is a hard fork of github.com/amitybell/piper-gen, with the following changes:

- refactored so my [grug brain](https://grugbrain.dev) could understand it
- updated to use the hard fork of Piper at https://github.com/piper-tts-go
- added support for macOS on Apple Silicon
- added two additional voices, `bryce` and `kristin`
- removed the `vi` voice

This project is a script to generate the binary data used by the Piper Go module.
